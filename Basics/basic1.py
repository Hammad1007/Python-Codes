# First initialize and declare a variable

a = 9               # integer type
b = 9.8             # float type
c = 9.888888888888  # double type
d = 'a'             # character type

# Print the variable datatype
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))

# In python, there are no libraries or header files to initialize the keywords as in C or C++. We can directly start with the program in python
# To check for the dtataype used, we type the keyword "type" as in the statements above
