# Code here

# First initialize and declare a variable

a = 9               # integer type
b = 9.8             # float type
c = 9.888888888888  # double type
d = 'a'             # character type

# Print the variable value through print statements
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)

# In python, there are no libraries or header files to initialize the keywords as in C or C++. We can directly start with the program in python
